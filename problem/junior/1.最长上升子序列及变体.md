## Problem Description


Assuming we have a list, such as {7, 1, 3, 2, 6, 5}, we define a move operation as MOVE, then how many MOVES we need in order to make the list orderable. Write a program to get n MOVES of any input list.

eg.
{7, 1, 3, 2, 6, 5} need 3 MOVES

3 moves to back of 2
5 moves to front of 6
7 moves to the last position
then list would be orderable
